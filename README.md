# Snowflake Stage Inspector
Stage Inspector helps you to analyse your Snowflake internal and external stages.
You have two pages:
### Explorer
- Surf through your stages, check parameters
- Get a list of the files on your stages
- Even you can manage your stage files: upload, download or remove them (only internal stages)

### Usage
- Overall size of your internal stages
- Getting familiar your biggest files


## Installation
How can you run this app?
This app based on the excellent [Streamlit framework](https://streamlit.io/).
The best option is to run it on the [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

If you rather choose to run it locally here is your guide.

### Create the virtual environment and install the packages
So, first create your favorite virtual env and download the necessary packages. Streamlit will install among the other packages in the requirement.txt.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Snowflake connection
This app connects to a Snowflake account so you need to [create a trial Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/) if you want to test and don't have one yet.

You need to create a special file for your secrets. You can put it under your home directory:
```sh
~/.streamlit/secrets.toml
```
or create a folder/file in this project:
```sh
./.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

The content should be something like this:
```toml
[snowflake]
user = "_your_snowflake_username_"
password = "_your_snowflake_password_"
account = "_your_snowflake_account_identifier_"
role = "_your_snowflake_role_"
warehouse = "_your_snowflake_warehouse_"
database = "_your_snowflake_database_"
schema = "public"
```

You can find more explanation in the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app/connect-to-data-sources/secrets-management).

### Run your Streamlit locally
And now you can simply run your Streamlit application:
```
streamlit run Home.py
```
